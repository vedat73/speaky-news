## Speaky News is a news app that can also voice the news content.
 - Newyork Times API was used to fetch news.
 - You must have your API KEY that is given by the NYT API freely. Visit this link : https://developer.nytimes.com/accounts/login
 - Put your api key into Utils/Constants.swift APIKey constant.
 - UIKit framework was used with MVVM pattern
 - Image caching, data prefetching, operation queues handling approaches were also included. I think it is worth to take a look 
 - The following video shows a quick preview
